# Question101
A variety of tools centered around  a program used to create and read .ioi files (Files for a sheet of w5h questions)

ExampleQandA.txt is an example text file, which can be converted to be run by the main program using exporter.py. Also, ExampleQandA.txt has instructions in it to create your own set of questions.

exporter.py is what is used to convert raw text files into readable .ioi files. It is text based, so should be run from an idle or terminal.

question101_text.py is a text based script to test .ioi files that have been made. It runs through the entire file, asking all the questions, but is very basic and unintresting to use. SHould generaly be used by creators as a lighweight way to test their files.
